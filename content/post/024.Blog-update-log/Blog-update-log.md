It took some time, but I finally finished revamping the blog, so let's talk about what I did!

### Theme
First up is the brand new theme, here using the original paid theme from https://www.ihewro.com/.
The revamp took about 5 hours to configure the theme, plugins, etc.
Overall, the follow up was the following

 - Click on the left avatar to enter the time machine
 - Archiving Timeline.
 - message board

The new theme uses a site-wide PJAX load, that is, when you click on the link does not feel the page jump, partial refresh of the page!
