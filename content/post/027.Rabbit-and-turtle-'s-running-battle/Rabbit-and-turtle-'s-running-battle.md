For a long time, I felt that the people around me kept surpassing myself again and again, people who were not as good at technology as myself learned various technology stacks, and people with less education than myself caught up and went to elite schools.

As the title says, the tortoise and hare race is an eternal story.

I've really been feeling out of shape lately, and I also promise this is the last time I'll post an article like this, and I need to get adjusted as soon as possible in the short term, starting with making sure I have plenty of time to work and study.

Good luck and peace.
